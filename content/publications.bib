  abstract = {In the current artificial intelligence (AI) era, the scale and quality of the dataset play a crucial role in training a high-quality AI model. However, good data is not a free lunch and is always hard to access due to privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A potential solution is to release a synthetic dataset with a similar distribution to that of the private dataset. Nevertheless, in some scenarios, it has been found that the attributes needed to train an AI model belong to different parties, and they cannot share the raw data for synthetic data publication due to privacy regulations. In PETS 2023, Xue et al. [29] proposed the first generative adversary network-based model, VertiGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication. However, after thoroughly investigating, we found that VertiGAN is less effective in preserving the correlation among the attributes of different parties. This article proposes a Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network, VFLGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication to address the above issues. Our experimental results show that compared with VertiGAN, VFLGAN significantly improves the quality of synthetic data. Taking the MNIST dataset as an example, the quality of the synthetic dataset generated by VFLGAN is 3.2 times better than that generated by VertiGAN w.r.t. the Frechet Distance. We also designed a more efficient and effective Gaussian mechanism for the proposed VFLGAN to provide the synthetic dataset with a differential privacy guarantee. On the other hand, differential privacy only gives the upper bound of the worst-case privacy guarantee. This article also proposes a practical auditing scheme that applies membership inference attacks to estimate privacy leakage through the synthetic dataset.},

  abstract = {Consumers seeking a new mobile plan have many choices in the present mobile landscape. The Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) has recently gained considerable attention among these options. MVNOs offer various benefits, making them an appealing choice for a majority of consumers. These advantages encompass flexibility, access to cutting-edge technologies, enhanced coverage, superior customer service, and substantial cost savings. Even though MVNO offers several advantages, it also creates some security and privacy concerns for the customer simultaneously. For instance, in the existing solution, MVNO needs to hand over all the sensitive details, including the users' identities and master secret keys of their customers, to a mobile operator (MNO) to validate the customers while offering any services. This allows MNOs to have unrestricted access to the MVNO subscribers' location and mobile data, including voice calls, SMS, and Internet, which the MNOs frequently sell to third parties (e.g., advertisement companies and surveillance agencies) for more profit. Although critical for mass users, such privacy loss has been historically ignored due to the lack of practical and privacy-preserving solutions for registration and handover procedures in cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a universally composable authentication and handover scheme with strong user privacy support, where each MVNO user can validate a mobile operator (MNO) and vice-versa without compromising user anonymity and unlinkability support. Here, we anticipate that our proposed solution will most likely be deployed by the MVNO(s) to ensure enhanced privacy support to their customer(s).},

  abstract = {Energy theft, characterized by manipulating energy consumption readings to reduce payments, poses a dual threat-causing financial losses for grid operators and undermining the performance of smart grids. Effective Energy Theft Detection (ETD) methods become crucial in mitigating these risks by identifying such fraudulent activities in their early stages. However, the majority of current ETD methods rely on supervised learning, which is hindered by the difficulty of labelling data and the risk of overfitting known attacks. To address these challenges, several unsupervised ETD methods have been proposed, focusing on learning the normal patterns from honest users, specifically the reconstruction of input. However, our investigation reveals a limitation in current unsupervised ETD methods, as they can only detect anomalous behaviours in users exhibiting regular patterns. Users with high-variance behaviours pose a challenge to these methods. In response, this paper introduces a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)-based ETD approach. This innovative approach demonstrates impressive ETD performance on high-variance smart grid data by incorporating additional attributes correlated with energy consumption. The proposed methods improve the average ETD performance on high-variance smart grid data from below 0.5 to over 0.9 w.r.t. AUC. On the other hand, our experimental findings indicate that while the state-of-the-art ETD methods based on reconstruction error can identify ETD attacks for the majority of users, they prove ineffective in detecting attacks for certain users. To address this, we propose a novel ensemble approach that considers both reconstruction error and forecasting error, enhancing the robustness of the ETD methodology. The proposed ensemble method improves the average ETD performance on the stealthiest attacks from nearly 0 to 0.5 w.r.t. 5%-TPR.},

Our proposed PGUS framework introduces a new cryptographic primitive called the Sanitizable Blind Signature (SBS), along with a novel Authentication and Key Agreement protocol named PGUS-AKA. Additionally, we have developed a seamless handover protocol, PGUS-HO, which is designed to secure all communication within a Thick MVNO environment. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough formal security analysis within the Universal Composability (UC) framework to address key threats, providing a strong solution for securing next-generation mobile networks. We also provide the evaluations on a 5G testbed which demonstrate the effectiveness of PGUS.},

  abstract = {With the proliferation of 5G networks, it is essential to prioritise robust security and seamless compatibility with existing infrastructure. The Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) and Handover (HO) protocols are crucial in securing communication links and maintaining user privacy in 5G networks. While 5G-AKA represents a significant improvement over its predecessors, it still cannot achieve some important security features, such as perfect forward security (PFS) and forward privacy (PFP), leaving data confidentiality and user privacy susceptible to compromise. Moreover, linkability vulnerabilities in the 5G-AKA pose additional privacy concerns, particularly in the face of active adversaries seeking to compromise user anonymity. To enhance the security and privacy of 5G protocols (5G-AKA and 5G-HO), we aim to achieve PFS and PFP while aligning with 5G's symmetric-key foundations. In this article, we introduce Pretty Good User Privacy (PGUP), a novel symmetric-based scheme aimed at addressing security and privacy vulnerabilities in the current 5G-AKA and HO protocols. In this article, we introduce a new variant of Puncturable Key Wrapping (ie, PKW+), which allows us to ensure PFS and PFP while maintaining resilience against DoS (desynchronization) attacks in our proposed protocols. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is resilient against all the essential security threats by performing a comprehensive formal security analysis. We also conduct relevant experiments to show the cost-effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {Detecting energy theft is vital for effectively managing power grids, as it ensures precise billing and prevents financial losses. Split-learning emerges as a promising decentralized machine learning technique for identifying energy theft while preserving user data confidentiality. Nevertheless, traditional split learning approaches are vulnerable to privacy leakage attacks, which significantly threaten data confidentiality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel GAN-Transformer-based split learning framework in this paper. This framework leverages the strengths of the transformer architecture, which is known for its capability to process long-range dependencies in energy consumption data. Thus, it enhances the accuracy of energy theft detection without compromising user privacy. A distinctive feature of our approach is the deployment of a novel mask-based method, marking a first in its field to effectively combat privacy leakage in split learning scenarios targeted at AI-enabled adversaries. This method protects sensitive information during the model's training phase. Our experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed framework not only achieves accuracy levels comparable to conventional methods but also significantly enhances privacy protection. The results underscore the potential of the GAN-Transformer split learning framework as an effective and secure tool in the domain of energy theft detection.},

  abstract = {Package delivery is a critical aspect of various industries, but it often incurs high financial costs and inefficiencies when relying solely on human resources. The last-mile transport problem, in particular, contributes significantly to the expenditure of human resources in major companies. Robot-based delivery systems have emerged as a potential solution for last-mile delivery to address this challenge. However, robotic delivery systems still face security and privacy issues, like impersonation, replay, man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM), unlinkability, and identity theft. In this context, we propose a privacy-preserving multi-factor authentication scheme specifically designed for robot delivery systems. Additionally, AI-assisted robotic delivery systems are susceptible to machine learning-based attacks (e.g. FGSM, PGD, etc.). We introduce the first transformer-based audio-visual fusion defender to tackle this issue, which effectively provides resilience against adversarial samples. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous formal analysis of the proposed protocol and also analyse the protocol security using a popular symbolic proof tool called ProVerif and Scyther. Finally, we present a real-world implementation of the proposed robotic system with the computation cost and energy consumption analysis.

  abstract = {The transition from paper-based information to Electronic-Health-Records (EHRs) has driven various advancements in the modern healthcare industry. In many cases, patients need to share their EHR with healthcare professionals. Given the sensitive and security-critical nature of EHRs, it is essential to consider the security and privacy issues of storing and sharing EHR. However, existing security solutions excessively encrypt the whole database, thus requiring the entire database to be decrypted for each access request, which is time-consuming. On the other hand, the use of EHR for medical research (e.g., development of precision medicine and diagnostics techniques) and optimisation of practices in healthcare organisations require the EHR to be analysed. To achieve that, they should be easily accessible without compromising the patient’s privacy. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique called E-Tenon that not only securely keeps all EHR publicly accessible but also provides the desired security features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which an Open Database is used for protecting EHR. The proposed E-Tenon empowers patients to securely share their EHR under their own multi-level, fine-grained access policies. Analyses show that our system outperforms existing solutions in terms of computational complexity.},
